# Implement Selection Sort
Given a list of numbers, sort it using the Selection Sort algorithm.

## Example

```commandline
{
"arr": [5, 8, 3, 9, 4, 1, 7]
}
```

Output
```commandline
[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]
```
## Notes
- 1 <= length of the given list <= 4 * 10^3
- -10^9 <= number in the list <= 10^9

Time complexity For selection sort:
```
T = n(n-1)/2
```

	•	Best Case Time Complexity: Theta(n^2)
	•	Average Case Time Complexity: Theta(n^2)
	•	Worst Case Time Complexity: Theta(n^2)# ImplementSelectionSort
